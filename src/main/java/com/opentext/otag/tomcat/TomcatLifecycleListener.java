/**
 * Container wide singleton type service. This class is crucial to the
 * restart process when we are running inside of Tomcat. Its
 * {@link #containerReady} function is used by the deployed services to
 * determine when it is safe to initiate HTTP communications with the
 * Gateway. Services and apps <strong>must</strong> not interrupt Tomcat's
 * startup within Servlet type classes. So we provide a handler and hook it
 * into a deployed services/apps startup sequence.
 * <p>
 * This class should only ever be found in a jar within Tomcats lib to ensure that
 * webapp Classloaders inherit the instance loaded by Tomcats parent loader. We rely
 * on this mechanism.
